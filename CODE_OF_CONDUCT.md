# Code of Conduct for Phlowers

Welcome to the Phlowers project! We aim to foster a welcoming, collaborative, and respectful community. By participating in this project, you agree to adhere to the following principles.

## Specific Guidelines

**Be Open and Inclusive.**  
Everyone is welcome to contribute to Phlowers. Use public channels for discussions unless confidentiality is necessary. Public conversations encourage transparency and collective problem-solving.

**Be Respectful and Kind.**  
Treat others with empathy, patience, and kindness. Disagreements are natural, but personal attacks, threats, or derogatory comments are not tolerated. Assume good intentions and strive for constructive resolutions.

**Foster Collaboration.**  
Our collective success depends on sharing knowledge and building on each other’s contributions. Be ready to explain your work to help others learn and improve the project.

**Encourage Learning and Curiosity.**  
No one has all the answers. Questions are essential to growth—ask them freely and answer them thoughtfully. Redirect questions to the appropriate resources when needed.

**Communicate Thoughtfully.**  
Choose your words carefully. Avoid harmful language and respect differences. Phlowers will not tolerate:

**Threats or violent language.**  
Discriminatory remarks, including those based on race, gender, or any other identity.  
Sharing explicit, violent, or sensitive personal content without consent.
Personal insults or targeted harassment.
Encouraging or engaging in harmful behavior.

**Be Mindful of Boundaries.**  
If someone asks you to stop a behavior, stop immediately. Respect personal and professional boundaries to maintain a safe and supportive environment.

By following this Code of Conduct, we ensure that Phlowers remains a space where creativity, collaboration, and growth can thrive.
