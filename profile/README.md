🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is our organization all about?

Phlowers is an open-source library suite for studying power lines, written in Python.

The suite includes:
- **mechaphlowers**: a package dedicated to mechanical and geometrical calculations for overhead power lines.
- **thermohl**: a package focused on thermal analysis of overhead power lines: it allows to compute
temperature or maximum intensity transiting in lines.


👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find docs?
