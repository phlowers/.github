## üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è A short introduction - what is our organization all about?

Phlowers is a collection of open-source tools for studying power lines, Python powered.

The suite includes:

- **mechaphlowers**: a package dedicated to mechanical and geometrical calculations for overhead power lines.
- **thermohl**: a package focused on thermal analysis of overhead power lines.
- **stellar**: an offline web application (PWA) based upon mechaphlowers to do power line analysis. 


## üë©‚Äçüíª Useful resources - where can the community find docs?

- [**mechaphlowers** functional documentation](https://phlowers.readthedocs.io/projects/mechaphlowers/en/latest/)
